# Cipher
A website idea based on the famous Wordle game!

You are given three words a day, all encrypted by a shift of 1-10 using the Caesar Cipher.
Your job is to decrypt the words, with only three tries on each word!

Currently this idea is still in the process of being planned out, so the UI is complete but the back end is just beginning. :)
